# EM-Noti

lets you read your top 10 gmails from primary inbox.

I made this as a learning project. I always missed gmail notifications as my browser did not send push notifications when not opened. So, I needed something specific to update me of my latest gmail.

Snippets and subject line as shown in gmail UI is implemented.

- Automatically starts at startup.
- runs in the background.

## How to try?

-> you can add your credentials (from google oauth 2.0 client IDs section) in the credentials folder -> credentials.txt and then, you can run the app once. This should prompt you to login to google and after you accept consent of EM Noti to access your email, then it should generate a file token.txt inside credentials folder. 

After that, you can run 

```npm run build```

You will get an installer inside the dist folder. Installation can be done using that.
